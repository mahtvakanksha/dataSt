#concepts of OOP:
1:Object: real world entity, having physical and logical occurence
2:class:collection of objects, that provides blueprint for each objects
3:inheritance:acquiring prop of parent or base class
4:polymorphism:doing one task in different ways
5:abstraction:hiding unnecessary details and showing functionality only
6:encapsulation:binding code and data together in ine single unit
7:overloading:assigning new functionality to an existing operator to operate on a new different kind of data type

#advantages of OOP:
1-easy maintenance and dev
2-abtraction
3-more real world usecases

NOTE:CPP is partial OOP because:
it supports POP
global var are accessible everywhere in the prog(violates encapsulation)

#disadvantages :
steep learning curve
slower execution
