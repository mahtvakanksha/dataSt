CLASS:

a blueprint, or a template, set of instructions to build objects
to group similar objects
class members are pvt by default
instance--->obj

syntax--->
Class class_name{
    data members;
    member_functions();
};

similiarities with structure:
both are container types
both have members
both can implement interfaces

differences with structure:
structure are VALUE types but classes are REFERENCE types
(i.e, structure *vars* have data from structure but *objects* have refernce to the class data)
members are public by default in str, pvt in class
use struct only to group data, and class when better functionality required


syntax of structure:
struct structure_name{
    type strmem1;
    type strmem2;
};
