function within class declaration
can be defined either inside the class or outside(implicit and explicit)

explicit uses scope resolution:
for ex- ref memFunctions.cpp

TYPES:
1-simple: normal function

2-static: i can only access static data members and those static data members must be initialized outside the class definition(globally) using scope resolution:

#syntax:int class_name::y=10;

#and the static data members can be accessed even in non-static member memFunctions

3-const:i've only got one job:dont modify the state of an object,(neither const or normal data members)-->though i can access both

#whereas const data members can't be modified once initialized. neither in normal nor evn in const function

4-inline:i will expand wherever i am called, rather than being invoked by a function call{MUST SEE friend function FROM another CLASS}-->confusing

5-friend:i have the access to even private members of a class, even when i am not their member
it can modify private data, it can be a global function or a member function from another class
