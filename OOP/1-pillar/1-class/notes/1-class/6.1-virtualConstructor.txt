a constructor in CPP can never be virtual because constructor is called when an object is created, and at that time we dont have virtuasl table in memory{since virtual table gets created when we have base ptr referncing to derived class object}
but virtual destructor is possible

d *derived = new d();
When d *derived = new d(); is executed, the constructor of d is called. Because d inherits from b, the constructor of b is called first, followed by the constructor of d.
