In C++, there is no direct concept of a "virtual copy constructor" since constructors cannot be virtual.However, you can achieve similar functionality by using a virtual clone method

A copy constructor is a special type of constructor that is used to create an object that is an exact copy of the object that is passed.

A virtual function is a member function that is declared in the parent class and is
redefined(overridden) in a child class that inherits the parent class.

With the use of a virtual copy constructor, the programmer will be able to create an object without knowing the exact data type of the object.


if we want to let the run time define the data type of object, we make virtual copy constructor

the virtual clone method is part of base class, and overridden in derived class to return copy of the obj
