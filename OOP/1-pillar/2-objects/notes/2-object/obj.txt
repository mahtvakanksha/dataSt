The difference between a class and an object in C++ (and in many other object-oriented programming languages) can be summarized as follows:

Class
Definition: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that the objects created from the class will have.
Purpose: Classes are used to encapsulate data and functions that operate on that data, promoting modularity and reusability.
Declaration: A class is declared using the class keyword, followed by the class name and a body that defines its members.

Object
Definition: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that occupies memory and has state. When you create an object, you are creating a specific instance of a class with its own unique set of data.
Purpose: Objects are used to store actual data and interact with other objects and functions. They represent real-world entities and are manipulated in the program to perform various operations.
Creation: An object is created (or instantiated) using the class definition. This process is often referred to as instantiation.

Class:

A class is a blueprint or template.
It defines attributes and methods.
It does not occupy memory until an object is created.
Example: class Car { ... };


Object:

An object is an instance of a class.
It has a state and occupies memory.
It is created using the class definition.
Example: Car myCar;
