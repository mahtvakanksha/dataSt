implementation of functions cant always be provided in base class if we dont know--->abstract class
we cant creat objects of abstract class

a pure virtual function is a cpp virtual function for which we can have implementation but it needs to be overridden in derived class
to avoid making even derived function abstract like base class

always assign 0 to pure virtual function declaration


pointers and refernces,constructors of abstract class types are allowed
